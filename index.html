* You should be working on finishing the regression assignment, and Poster Prep Stage III this week. 
* You will be building models, and having to decide which model fits the data best using different criteria. 
    - Textbook references: Open Intro 8.2, Applied Statistics Notebook Section 7.7


### 4/15/19 - [Week 12](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk12.html)

SET's this week. Please be present. 

We're starting to talk about multivariable models this week. This involves
understanding how to think about simultaneous relationships between multiple variables. 

Life isn't bivariate. We "know" there is more to how big a caterpillar is than simply the species. What about the temperature? was it a drought year? what type of tree is it on? How heavy is the bird predation in that area? What other species are on the same tree that could be competing for resources? To understand the singular effect of bird predation on caterpillar size, we must consider how all other factors affect caterpillar size, and how those other factors might be related to each other as well. 

The course notes is a "cliff notes" version of the lecture material for this coures. If you're not watching the videos (even on 1.5x speed) you are missing critical information that I will not lecture on in class, but that you will be responsible for on the homework and exam. 

**Due this week**

* HW09 - Moderation
* Poster prep stage II - this includes a full revision of all stage 1 slides, and adding slides for two bivariate analyses. 


### 4/8/19 - [Week 11](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk11.html)

DataFest is over and so I'm back 100% with you!

We're finishing up Bivariate Inference this week. 

* Correlation & Regression - similar, but different purposes. 
* HW 8 due this Saturday
* Think about which inferential tools you are going to want to use on your personal research questions. 

Self and peer evaluation form available: Due Sunday https://forms.gle/Vrhf9FEqwiWYPD4N9

### 4/1/19 - [Week 10](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk10.html)

This week got lost in the post-sickness & pre-DataFest ether. 


#### Midterm Error Assessment (Optional - Due 4/5/19)
As an opportunity to look for patterns in your test taking and to develop strategies to perform better in the future, there is an optional error assessment that you can complete. If you do so you can earn up to half the points missed on the exam back. To do this you must use the [Analyzing exam errors form](reading/Analyzing exam errors.pdf) available on the materials page. Using this form you will: 

* Classify the types of errors you made (where you lost points). 
    - Identify common patterns or themes.
* On a separate paper, correctly re-work every problem you missed. 
* Go over your corrections with a tutor (or me). 
    - Explain what you did wrong and why your corrections are right.
    - Discuss strategies to perform better on future exams.

<h3>10-14-2019 Week 8: Statistical Inference via Hypothesis Testing</h3>
<p>The rest of the semester is all about Inference! This is what you’ve been training for, and waiting for. This week we’ll start out with setting the foundations of the process on 1 variable, then quickly move into testing relationships between two variables.</p>
<ul>
<li>Midterms should be back by Wed or Friday</li>
<li>HW 8 BIG assignment! Has multiple parts.</li>
<li>one-on-one online help with R coming soon. Wesleyan (Passion Driven Stats Developers) is offering drop in one on one help via Zoom. Link and times forthcoming.</li>

<div id="week-7-simulation-sampling-probability-distributions" class="section level3">
<h3>10-07-2019 Week 7: Simulation, sampling, probability distributions</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve had a chance to learn what your data looks like, exploring relationships and learning more about the variables that you are interested in researching, let’s take a step back and look at the big picture. You will use lecture notes on writing empirical research (found on the materials page of this website) to guide the writing of a research proposal.</p>
<p>Applied statistics is used to support research. Numbers and measures don’t stand on their own. It is important that you understand how to use data to support scienctific research.</p>
<p>So far you have been conducting an exploratory data analysis to learn the distributions of your measures, and to assess for any possible relationships in your research. You cannot make any statistical claims about whether or not a relationship is significant at this point. That is under the realm of <em>inferential statistics</em> and will be the topic of the class after Spring break.</p>
<p>To understand why inferential statistics can be used to make valid claims, we have to learn a little bit about <em>Probability</em> first. This topic is only briefly covered in the PDS videos. You will have to spend more time in the course packet, AND in the OpenIntro textbook if you have never taken a statistics course before.</p>
<p>This is a much more mathematical section of the course, so be sure to plan your time accordingly. Over the next two weeks you should be writing your research proposal, working on your poster preparation slides, and filling out the notes and examples in the course packet. We will be working heavily out of the course packet, so it is essential that you read the material ahead of time so the examples we work through in class are meaningful.</p>
<p><em>Week overview</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Two in class exercises (mon, fri)</li>
<li>HW07 due in google drive &amp; worksheet – Part of this will be due Wednesday</li>
<li>Quiz 7 - Quantifying Uncertainty. <strong>Due Thursday</strong>. Group quiz on Friday.
<ul>
<li>Relies heavily on PDS video and reading the course notes section 4.5-4.6</li>
<li>Must have a fundamental understanding of how to calculate a confidence interval</li>
</ul></li>

<h3>09-30-2019 Week 6: Reflection, Midterm, and new stuff.</h3>
<p>We’re going to switch gears here and talk about probability, but before we do that let’s take a step back and think about what we’ve learned so far and consider how our thoughts about Statistics has changed due to this new information. It’s also a time for self reflection. How are you doing in this class? Are you happy with your grade? What can you do differently?</p>
<p>This week is mostly about prepping for the exam. We will do a probabilty activity on wednesday to get us ready for the next unit.</p>
<p><strong>Updates</strong> I have cxl’d HW 6 (research proposal). Quiz 6 is still required but will stay open until Monday night.</p>

<div id="week-5-describing-relationships" class="section level3">
<h3>09-23-2019 Week 5: Describing Relationships</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s ok to struggle, it’s not OK to not do anything. If you are having trouble with coding, you need to ask for help. This class builds on each assignment. You can’t do HW05 well if you didn’t do HW04. You won’t be able to do HW06 if you can’t do HW05. Don’t risk falling behind, you will struggle to catch up and may not pass. There are five of us available to help you during office hours and Community Coding. You can make appointments with any of us outside of our scheduled hours as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This week we will discuss how to create visualizations to assess the relationship between two variables.</li>
<li>The homework assignments are training grounds for you to practice how to create and interpret graphics to explore your research question. The graphs you make for the homework may or may not be directly related to your research question.</li>
<li><p>You may have to go back to your raw data and pull in new measures. Or adjust your variables (like collapsing levels) based on what you observed in last week’s assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Monday 2pm OH cancelled this week. Extra OH Monday at 9, and Wed at 9am.</p></li>

<p>I’m alive!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OH Cancelled Monday. Sorry, lot of Drs appts in the upcoming weeks that were scheduled months ago. Additional OH Wednesday at 9am</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there’s one take home message for this week, is to describe the distribution of variables you need:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a picture</li>
<li>summary statistics</li>
<li>a complete sentence interpretation</li>
</ol>
<p>While your goal should be to make figures stand alone, you won’t be there quite yet. Your coding skills will develop as you go on throughout the semester.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will also start the work to build your research poster. See the <a href="project.html">project instructions</a> page for details. This means you have <em>two</em> assignments due this Friday. Procrastinate at your own peril.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Re: Homework 03. I will adjusted the grading rubric to downweight the data management portion. This is a wakeup call for all of you who tried to start the HW on Saturday evening. You won’t be able to do HW for this class in an evening. There is a reason we work on it all week in class. I advise going and reading the <a href="reading/Advice%20from%20prior%20Math%20315%20students.pdf">[advice from last year’s students]</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:red"><strong>HW03 is a critical assignment</strong></span> You can’t complete any remaining homework until you get this file working. If you were unsuccessful this week, your goal is to work with your resources (each other, tutors, peer mentors, office hours, community coding) until you get it working.</p>

<p>Due to a glitch in the system, Quiz 1 is going to be considered a “trial run” and not count towards your grade.</p>
<p>This week we’re going to cover the basic data types, how to formulate a testable research hypotheses on your selected data, and setting up a reproducible research pipeline to prepare data for analysis.</p>
<p>Haven’t selected a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jULudBjRbHdW-uLIvmMbxRBEJJkq9crY">[research data set]</a> yet? Look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kyRCJMYQ4fa3RveUOH1EgwZyzOvRLzNy0uQajEEtarg/edit?usp=sharing">[sign up sheet]</a> to see what’s left and sign up to analyze a data set. If you don’t have a partner yet, put your name down by a data set you are interested in analyzing, or post in the #assignments channel in slack that you’re looking for a partner.</p>
