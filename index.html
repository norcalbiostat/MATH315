* You should be working on finishing the regression assignment, and Poster Prep Stage III this week. 
* You will be building models, and having to decide which model fits the data best using different criteria. 
    - Textbook references: Open Intro 8.2, Applied Statistics Notebook Section 7.7


### 11/26/18 - [Week 13](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk13.html)
<span style="color:red">**Summary of schedule updates**</span>   

* [Regression assignment](hw/hw10_regression.html) has been re-written and cut down significantly. 
* Poster prep stage III will not have a peer review
* Final we be take home, poster presentations will occur during the 2 hour final period. 
* Exam 2 has been curved, no error assessment will take place.
    - An optional set of questions on Exam 2 content will be made available in Blackboard during finals week that can be used to make up some points. 

This week, let's ease back into things. Try to come back to "normal", when life is anything but normal.  

* Monday- Section review, recap, reorient
* Wednesday - Logistic Regression (**RAT** - be sure to watch PDS video ahead of time)
* Friday - Building interaction models, some open work time. 



### 11/19/18 - Fall Break. 
* Don't think about school, assignments or anything. 
* Please take some time to be among your family and practice self care in this incredibly stressful time. 

### 11/12/18 - Week 12 - Campus closed due to the Camp Fire
* Please check in with me on Slack or email to let me know you're OK (or if you're not OK. I want to know that too!)
* If you lived in the fire affected area please let me know. I want to support you in any way I can to finish the semester. Please check out campus resources: https://www.csuchico.edu/campfire/assistance.shtml 
* If you were not affected, please consider volunteering to help out those that have been, and/or helping raise funds through the Wildcats Rise Fire recovery fund https://app.mobilecause.com/vf/WildcatsRise 


### 11/5/18 - [Week 11](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk11.html)

* Some final thoughts about regression models
    - explanatory vs predictive
    - how to measure model fit - coefficient of determination $R^2$
    - how outliers can affect the model
* What's the difference between an Observational study and an Experiment? 
    - why can't we make causal statements on observational studies? 
* Buliding multiple variable models 
    - how adding additional measures into a regression model acts as a "control"
    - expressing multiple regression models mathematically
* Friday: Campus closed

### 10/29/18 - [Week 10](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk10.html)

* Open work day on Monday. Finish those assignments! 
* Lecture on Moderation on Wednesday - watch the PDS Video 14 ahead of time.

<div id="week-6" class="section level3">
<h3>2/24/19 - <a href="https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk06.html">Week 6</a></h3>
<p>Now that youâve had a chance to learn what your data looks like, exploring relationships and learning more about the variables that you are interested in researching, letâs take a step back and look at the big picture. You will use lecture notes on writing empirical research (found on the materials page of this website) to guide the writing of a research proposal.</p>
<p>Applied statistics is used to support research. Numbers and measures donât stand on their own. It is important that you understand how to use data to support scienctific research.</p>
<p>So far you have been conducting an exploratory data analysis to learn the distributions of your measures, and to assess for any possible relationships in your research. You cannot make any statistical claims about whether or not a relationship is significant at this point. That is under the realm of <em>inferential statistics</em> and will be the topic of the class after Spring break.</p>
<p>To understand why inferential statistics can be used to make valid claims, we have to learn a little bit about <em>Probability</em> first. This topic is only briefly covered in the PDS videos. You will have to spend more time in the course packet, AND in the OpenIntro textbook if you have never taken a statistics course before.</p>
<p>This is a much more mathematical section of the course, so be sure to plan your time accordingly. Over the next two weeks you should be writing your research proposal, working on your poster preparation slides, and filling out the notes and examples in the course packet. We will be working heavily out of the course packet, so it is essential that you read the material ahead of time so the examples we work through in class are meaningful.</p>
<div id="three-quizzes-this-week" class="section level4">

<h3>2/18/19 - <a href="https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk05.html">Week 5</a> - Exploring Relationships</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Itâs ok to struggle, itâs not OK to not do anything. If you are having trouble with coding, you need to ask for help. This class builds on each assignment. You canât do HW05 well if you didnât do HW04. You wonât be able to do HW06 if you canât do HW05. Donât risk falling behind, you will struggle to catch up and may not pass. There are five of us available to help you with a combined total 10 hours of office hours. You can make appointments with any of us outside of our scheduled hours as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This week we will discuss how to create visualizations to assess the relationship between two variables.</li>
<li>The homework assignments are training grounds for you to practice how to create and interpret graphics to explore your research question. The graphs you make for the homework may or may not be directly related to your research question.</li>
<li>You may have to go back to your raw data and pull in new measures. Or adjust your variables (like collapsing levels) based on what you observed in last weekâs assignment.</li>
<li>Typo in the course notes on page 40. Be sure to get notes &amp; the in-class worksheet from someone to make sure your book is updated.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>No quiz on exploring numeric data. Prepare answers in the course notes section 2.1 instead (for Mon/Tue) and 2.2 (for Wed/Thu).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If thereâs one take home message for this week, is to describe the distribution of variables you need:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a picture</li>
<li>summary statistics</li>
<li>a complete sentence interpretation</li>
</ol>
<p>While your goal should be to make figures stand alone, you wonât be there quite yet. Your coding skills will develop as you go on throughout the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Advice: Complete the <code>ggplot2</code> lesson in DataCamp (and corresponding blackboard learn quiz) EARLY this week. It will make coding in ggplot throughout the week much easier. </strong></p>

<p>We are starting to code in R this week. You must have completed the Data Camp assignments from last week to be ready for this. In class you will work with your partner to take a closer look at your codebook to identify what types of data management you will have to do. The <a href="notes/lec03_dm_prep_notes.html">[lec03_dm_prep_questions]</a> lecture notes that can be found on the course materials page contain questions to help guide this process.</p>
