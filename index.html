Additional information on this new survey, such as full wording of the question on how the variables were coded can be found in the [[codebook]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/FinalDocs/OOL%20Codebook.pdf) and [[survey questionnaire]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/FinalDocs/OOL%20Questionnaire.pdf). **Do not bring these to the final**. They are for you to use as reference material while you are learning to understand this survey.   

<span style="color:red">**Review List**</span> 
This final exam is comprehensive in that everything in this class builds upon previous topics. 
Here are a list of topics to review. All topics have equal importance, regardless of the time that was spent on each topic during class. 

* Probability
* Creating and interpreting confidence intervals
* Assumptions for statistical methods to be valid
* Generalizability, representativeness, bias, sampling frame
* Statistical Analysis Procedures: 
    - Two-sample T-tests for means and proportions
    - ANOVA and $\chi^{2}$ for multiple samples
    - Linear and Logistic regression.
* Identifying confounders, moderators and covariates. 
* Interpreting regression coefficients and making predictions using models. 
    - from linear and logistic models
    - using continuous and categorical variables

* **Class Attendance Required**: Due to a large number of people missing class lately, for the rest of the semester I will be taking attendance. You cannot work as a team if you don't bother to show up to class at the same time. 
    - We only have a few weeks left in the semester. This is a critical time in your project development.

### 9/21/17 - [Week 6](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk06.html)
I have gone through the gradebook and entered in 0's for missing assignments to date. This is done to provide you a better idea of where you stand grade-wise, going into this exam. Quizzes will remain open available up until the test on the 27th. So if you got a 0 on a Problem set or Data Camp quiz you have time to make up those points. This is also a good way to study for the exam. 


* Monday: Writing your research plan. Make sure you are paying attention to the research question spreadsheet. I'm leaving feedback and questions for you there!
* Wednesday: Exam 1. The weekly overview has details on how to prepare and a sample exam. 
* Friday: Probability. If it's been a while since you've had stats class you will have to spend some significant time preparing. 

### 9/18/17 - [Week 5](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk05.html)
* Recap the DM assignment template/instructions. 
* Univariate graphics assignment due this week. This is a peer reviewed assignment. Example template posted on [week 4](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk04.html).
* Peer review instructions have been added to the project page. 
* Monday we will lecture on how to interpret bivariate comparisons. The rest of the week you will work on creating them.

<div id="week-4" class="section level3">
<h3>9/17/18 - <a href="https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk04.html">Week 4</a></h3>
<p>The optional revision period to your peer review assignments has been added to the submission instructions on the <a href="help_assignments.html">[Help page]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Writing Research questions</strong></p>
<p>Your RQâs need to be explicit, and very simple. Is there an association between X and Y? How does X affect Y? Be as detailed and specific as possible. Ask a question where you can say âYesâ or âNoâ to. You also need to identify exactly what variable in the data set you are going to use to measure X and Y.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there an association between current age and binge drinking (more than 4 drinks for women and 5 for men in a 2 hour span) in the past month?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Data Management, Graphing and R errors Oh My!</strong></p>
<p>Weâll talk about how to identify features of data that will need to be changed prior to analysis. We canât cover them all, nor would you remember them all. This is a place where experience and repetition will be the true learning method. In the meantime, I provide a number of resources to help you identify what to look for.</p>
<p>You have 2 assignments to turn in this week 1) is your data management RMD code file, the other is a Graphing assignment. Be sure to carefully read the submission instructinos for each.</p>
</div>
<div id="week-3" class="section level3">
<h3>9/3/18 - <a href="https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk03.html">Week 3</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You should have been watching and following along with the PDS videos for about a week now. If you are not, do this ASAP or you will fall behind. Think of these as lecture, and in class as practice time.</li>
<li>Youâre going to be refining your research questions this week by conducting a literature review to see what the current state of knowledge is about your project.</li>
<li>Then weâll spend some time in the course notes learning how to describe the distribution of data using words, summary statistics and appropriate graphics.</li>
<li>This is your last chance to get all your R/R Studio bugs resolved. Next week weâre hitting the coding ground hard.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note about EC: If you attended a seminar I need some sort of writeup from you to demonstrate that you payed some attention to the statistical or data analysis content of the talk.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="week-2-data-entry-and-import" class="section level3">
<h3>9/04/18 - <a href="https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk02.html">Week 2</a> Data entry and import</h3>
<p>Office hours (Holt 202) M: 3p-4m, W: 1-2pm, R: 10-11am (<em>this weeks Wed hours are cancelled</em>)</p>
<p>This week weâre going to be talking about data, doing some data entry and importing data into R. Youâll start to choose specific variables to address your research questions, create your own team mini-codebook and participate in our first project based assignment that comes with a peer review.</p>
<p>Two great seminars lined up this week, one in Statistics one in Biology. Both are worth some EC if you attend. Theyâre at the same time, so you can only attend one (obv.) Flyers with details are in Slack.</p>
<p>Be sure to check the weekly schedule (linked above) for details on how to prepare for the week.</p>
<p><strong>Upcoming Assignments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two (2) DataCamp chapters. This course module is written by the authors of the Open Intro Statistics textbook, the course title in Data Camp is âData Analysis and Statistical Inferenceâ. In the Assignments tab in DataCamp, you will only see the chapter title.
<ul>
<li>Introduction to R</li>
<li>Introduction to data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Corresponding Blackboard Learn quizzes. <em>(2 attempts)</em></li>
<li>Problem set 2.2 - Blackboard quiz of 10 randomly selected questions from a pool of questions. <em>(Unlimited attempts)</em></li>
