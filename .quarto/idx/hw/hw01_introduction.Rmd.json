Post an introduction to yourself in the #introductions channel. Tell us a little about you! Year, major, hometown, any extracurricular activities, one thing you are hoping to get out of this class, and one concern you have about this class. Oh.. and of course any mention of pets should include a photo!\n        \n## R and R Studio\nYou have two choices for using R this semester. You can install the necessary programs on your personal computer, or you can use R studio cloud. If you have already taken or are concurrently enrolled in Math 130 you should install these programs on your own computer. \n\n1. Install R and R Studio\n    * Follow the instructions from Math 130 to install and get started with R and R Studio. https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/notes/02_setup.html\n    * Complete all steps (including installing packages and reading on how to get help)\n    * You must install `LaTeX` via the `tinytex` package to turn your homework into PDF. \n\n\n2. Everyone learns differently, and the resources that are required in this class (PDS videos, course notes) may not quite work to explain a particular topic. **Find 3 different types of resources to learn R and Statistics. At least 2 must be chosen from provided resources from one of my websites**. These could include a video series other than the ones assigned with the course (passion drive stats), cheatsheets, discussion boards, books, course notes from a different class, etc. For each source: \n    * Explain where you found it (include URL as applicable)\n    * When was it last updated (how real time is your source)\n    * Describe how you will use this source\n\n3. Using the code chunk provided, calculate `2+2`\n\n\n# Part II: Becoming a better learner. \nBecause we all have room for improvement, here are a few tasks for you to become a better learner. \n\nFirst I want you to create a \"Learning Journal\". This could be a composition notebook, a smaller 5x7 \njournal, loose papers in a binder or an electronic document on your computer/cloud. We will be engaging\nin several activities throughout the semseter aimed to help you become active and effective learners. \nI will do several check-ins on your journal throughout the semester to ensure that it is being used. \n\nSome of these tasks will ask you to reflect on a reading. Here is a link to help you understand more\nabout what that actually means and how to write a reflection. \nhttps://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-to-reflect-on-reading\n\n### Metacognition \n\nFrom the materials page on the course website, download and read \"MAI and academic achievement in college students\". Once you are done, download and take the \"Metacognition Awareness Inventory\" (also available on the materials page). Submit your scores to Google Drive at this link: https://goo.gl/forms/FYgjJk72T3147e7f1 \n\nWrite a reflection on this reading. Were you surprised by the results? \n\n\n### Procrastination\nWatch this video on creating a cycle of success and tell me **one** concrete plans of action that you already implement, or are willing to give an honest try to do this semester to stay on track and not fall behind.  https://media.csuchico.edu/media/Avoiding+Procrastination/0_wquy9x90\n\n\nWrite this plan in your learning journal. \n\n\n### Being good at learning is hard!\nFrom the reading materials page on the course website, download and read the \"Learning (Your First Job)\" article.
