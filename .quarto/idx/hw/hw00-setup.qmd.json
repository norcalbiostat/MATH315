Get Organized\n\nUsing a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **reports**.\n\nYou need to choose a naming convention for your folders and try to stick with it. Recommended options are: \n\n* ALL CAPS (MATH315)\n* no caps (math315)\n* snake_case (math_315) \n* CamelCase (Math315) \n\nCreate this class folder along with the following three subfolders: \n\n* `data` - your data set and codebook go in here\n* `homework` - all assignment script files\n* `project`- code related to your research project\n\nYour working directory should now look similar to this:\n\n<center><img src=\"images/hw00_folder_org.png\" width=\"350px\"></center>\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n### Do not let everything live in your downloads folder.\nThis means when you download a file, right click and \"Save as\" or \"Save target as\" and **actively choose** where to download this file.

Everyone learns differently, and the resources that are required in this class (PDS videos, course notes) may not quite work to explain a particular topic. **Find 3 different types of resources to learn R and Statistics. At least 2 must be chosen from provided resources from one of my websites**. These could include a video series other than the ones assigned with the course (passion drive stats), cheatsheets, discussion boards, books, course notes from a different class, etc. For each source: \n    * Explain where you found it (include URL as applicable)\n    * When was it last updated (how real time is your source)\n    * Describe how you will use this source\n\n3.

This could be a composition notebook, a smaller 5x7 \njournal, loose papers in a binder or an electronic document on your computer/cloud. We will be engaging\nin several activities throughout the semseter aimed to help you become active and effective learners. \nI will do several check-ins on your journal throughout the semester to ensure that it is being used. \n\nSome of these tasks will ask you to reflect on a reading.
