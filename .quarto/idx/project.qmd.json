It looks exactly like the [evaluation criteria](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/lec/poster_guidelines/#evaluation-criteria).\n    - When not presenting, you will walk around and learn about others research. Ask them questions, fill out the evaluation on your phone as you go. Printed copies will be available upon request so you can submit later. \n* The final grade will be determined by\n    - Base score = **30%** student score + **70%** instructor score **+ bonus pts** for best in show awards. \n\n----\n\n## Grading Method\n\nInstead of assigning specific points to each stage and adding up the points for an overall score, this work will be done through a series of revisions gaining feedback from both your peers and the instructor at each stage. \n\n* For each slide to be assessed you will be marked as either \"needing revision\", \"meeting expectation\", or \"exemplary\".\n* I will update your status column for the slides that are being assessed at that stage. \n    - I will also check on any prior slides that are at 'needs revision' stage. \n* You can request a reassessment of prior work at (nearly) any time. (You can ask for it, I just may not get to it until the next time I'm reviewing slides.)\n* **You are responsible for keeping track of your status!** Suggestion - use conditional formatting on column F in your sheet. This is the color scheme I use:\n    - Go to \"Format --> Conditional Formatting\"\n    - Single color, apply to range F2:F22\n    - Format cells if \n        * `Text contains Not Assessible` (Red)\n        * `Text contains ME` (light green)\n        * `Text is exactly E` (dark green)\n        * `Text contains NR` (yellow)\n\n\n\n### Rubric\n\nThis is a method of 'ungrading' that I have been wanting to try for a while. At the math congress (camping conference) I attended the first week of October a math educator discussed this method with us and so I was inspired to finally test it out. This project is a perfect opportunity to do so. \n\nThis means that the Assessment item descriptions are a work in progress. Right now they are slightly modified from the old grading rubric. I may add, combine, or reword items as I do my revisions to better fit what I am actually looking for. \n\nEach person has their own 'project assessment' Google spreadsheet (same location as your poster) that shows you what achievement stage you are at for each item. It is locked to only view mode and only you and I have access to it. \n\n\n### ... but points!??\n\nIn the end this still has to be converted to a point value/letter grade right? So here's how I'm going to do it. The poster prep slides make up 80 out of the 110 points for the project. \n\n* If you have $\\geq$ 90% of assessment items at 'exemplary' and none at 'needs revision', that's \"A\" work and you get the full 80 pts. \n* If you have $\\geq$ 90% of assessment items at 'meets expectation' and no more than 1 at 'needs revision', that's \"B\" work and you get 72 pts. Note 'meeting expectation' does not correspond to _A_ level work\n* If you have $\\geq$ 80% of assessment items at 'meets expectation' and no more than 2 at 'needs revision', that's \"C\" work and you get 64 pts. \n\nThis is a graduate level class, so anything below a C is considered not passing. I don't expect anyone to be at that stage by the end of the semester. \n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Overview\n\nThroughout the entire semester you will be analyzing a data set with the end goal of creating a poster presentation to present your research.

It looks exactly like the [evaluation criteria](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/lec/poster_guidelines/#evaluation-criteria).\n    - When not presenting, you will walk around and learn about others research. Ask them questions, fill out the evaluation on your phone as you go. Printed copies will be available upon request so you can submit later. \n* The final grade will be determined by\n    - Base score = **30%** student score + **70%** instructor score **+ bonus pts** for best in show awards. \n\n----\n\n## Grading Method\n\nInstead of assigning specific points to each stage and adding up the points for an overall score, this work will be done through a series of revisions gaining feedback from both your peers and the instructor at each stage. \n\n* For each slide to be assessed you will be marked as either \"needing revision\", \"meeting expectation\", or \"exemplary\".\n* I will update your status column for the slides that are being assessed at that stage. \n    - I will also check on any prior slides that are at 'needs revision' stage. \n* You can request a reassessment of prior work at (nearly) any time. (You can ask for it, I just may not get to it until the next time I'm reviewing slides.)\n* **You are responsible for keeping track of your status!** Suggestion - use conditional formatting on column F in your sheet. This is the color scheme I use:\n    - Go to \"Format --> Conditional Formatting\"\n    - Single color, apply to range F2:F22\n    - Format cells if \n        * `Text contains Not Assessible` (Red)\n        * `Text contains ME` (light green)\n        * `Text is exactly E` (dark green)\n        * `Text contains NR` (yellow)\n\n\n\n### Rubric\n\nThis is a method of 'ungrading' that I have been wanting to try for a while. At the math congress (camping conference) I attended the first week of October a math educator discussed this method with us and so I was inspired to finally test it out. This project is a perfect opportunity to do so. \n\nThis means that the Assessment item descriptions are a work in progress. Right now they are slightly modified from the old grading rubric. I may add, combine, or reword items as I do my revisions to better fit what I am actually looking for. \n\nEach person has their own 'project assessment' Google spreadsheet (same location as your poster) that shows you what achievement stage you are at for each item. It is locked to only view mode and only you and I have access to it. \n\n\n### ... but points!??\n\nIn the end this still has to be converted to a point value/letter grade right? So here's how I'm going to do it. The poster prep slides make up 80 out of the 110 points for the project. \n\n* If you have $\\geq$ 90% of assessment items at 'exemplary' and none at 'needs revision', that's \"A\" work and you get the full 80 pts. \n* If you have $\\geq$ 90% of assessment items at 'meets expectation' and no more than 1 at 'needs revision', that's \"B\" work and you get 72 pts. Note 'meeting expectation' does not correspond to _A_ level work\n* If you have $\\geq$ 80% of assessment items at 'meets expectation' and no more than 2 at 'needs revision', that's \"C\" work and you get 64 pts. \n\nThis is a graduate level class, so anything below a C is considered not passing. I don't expect anyone to be at that stage by the end of the semester.
