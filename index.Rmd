* This week is a lot of "book work". You will learn by reading and participating in class, your assignments are all assigned through Blackboard Learn. 
* Problem set 3.1 and 3.2 should have been officially assigned last week, they are set for being due EOD on Monday. 
    - Reminder: These due dates are so YOU are keeping up with the class. They will stay open until Exam 2, but the sooner you do them the better off you will be in class. 



### 10/1/18 - [Week 6](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk06.html)

* Monday: Next steps for the project - starting your poster slides. 
* Friday: Probability. This is a very brief overview, refer to the OpenIntro textbook and PDS videos for more learning. 

If you haven't done so in a while, you might want to check Slack. Especially the #assignments channel. I share important information on there.

### 2/18/19 - [Week 5](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk05.html) - Exploring Relationships


> It's ok to struggle, it's not OK to not do anything. If you are having trouble with coding, you need to ask for help. 
This class builds on each assignment. You can't do HW05 well if you didn't do HW04. You won't be able to do HW06 if you can't do HW05. 
Don't risk falling behind, you will struggle to catch up and may not pass. There are five of us available to help you with a combined total 10 hours of office hours. You can make appointments with any of us outside of our scheduled hours as well. 


* This week we will discuss how to create visualizations to assess the relationship between two variables. 
* The homework assignments are training grounds for you to practice how to create and interpret graphics to explore your research question. The graphs you make for the homework may or may not be directly related to your research question. 
* You may have to go back to your raw data and pull in new measures. Or adjust your variables (like collapsing levels) based on what you observed in last week's assignment. 

#### Items due this week:
* HW 06 - Bivariate Graphing
* Data Camp - Intro to Data (practice data management with R)
    - Don't forget to do the corresponding BBL quiz.
    
#### Events for this week (always free and open to all unless specified)

* [Data Science Seminar: Merging data from multiple tables using SQL](https://csudsi.netlify.com/2019/02/02/2019-02-02-dsi-seminar-spatial-is-special/) (Th 3-4pm, Tehama 116)
SQL is a powerful database language that is used to link information together across multiple tables. http://datascience.csuchico.edu

### 2/10/19 - [Week 4](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk04.html) - Making pretty pictures to win friends and influence people!

> No quiz on exploring numeric data. Prepare answers in the course notes section 2.1 instead (for Mon/Tue) and 2.2 (for Wed/Thu).

If there's one take home message for this week, is to describe the distribution of variables you need: 

1. a picture
2. summary statistics
3. a complete sentence interpretation

While your goal should be to make figures stand alone, you won't be there quite yet. Your coding skills will
develop as you go on throughout the semester. 

**Advice: Complete the `ggplot2` lesson in DataCamp (and corresponding blackboard learn quiz) EARLY this week. It will make coding in ggplot throughout the week much easier. **


#### Events for this week (always free and open to all unless specified)

* "Women Like You" Leadership Symposium (Drop in 10-2pm) https://as.csuchico.edu/women-like-you/ 
Distinguished female leaders share stories and discuss topics designed to inspire and empower all. With highlights from our own, Chico State faculty and staff will tell their personal stories of success and failure, sharing their journeys of resilience and rise as a woman in todayâ€™s social climate. Student attendees can enter to win from a pool of $5000 in textbook scholarship funds. 

* [Data Science Seminar: Spatial is Special](https://csudsi.netlify.com/2019/02/02/2019-02-02-dsi-seminar-spatial-is-special/) (Th 2-3pm, Tehama 116)
Learn how to start exploring and analyzing geographic data using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software. http://datascience.csuchico.edu

### 2/4/19 - [Week 3](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk03.html) - Hello R!

> OH Monday cancelled. I will be available 12-2pm and possibly 4-5pm instead. 

#### Second chance at Blackboard learn quizzes connected to DataCamp.
* The quizzes in Blackboard that correspond to DataCamp quizzes will be re-opened for partial credit this week. 

#### You have 2 assignments (and 2 pre-class video quizes) to turn in this week!
Read the instructions of each carefully to ensure that they are completed and submitted correctly. 

1. A literature review [[Homework 03]](hw/hw03_lit_review.html).
2. Demonstration of data management code [[Homework 04]](hw/hw04_data_management.html). 

We are starting to code in R this week. You must have completed the Data Camp assignments from last week to be ready for this. 
In class you will work with your partner to take a closer look at your codebook to identify what types of data management you will have to do. The [[lec03_dm_prep_questions]](notes/lec03_dm_prep_notes.html) lecture notes that can be found on the course materials page contain questions to help guide this process. 

#### Extra Materials

* I have created a video to walk you through how to get your data into R Studio. 
    - Right now this can only be acessed through Blackboard Learn. 
    - Watch this before class on Wednesday/Thursday
* The [[Help with R]](help_R.html) page has been updated to include more info such as useful functions and how to navigate data. 

#### Entering a challenging time

You may feel like this in the next couple weeks: 

<center><img src="img/hard.jpg" width="400" height="400" align='center'/></center>
<br>

But if you use the references in the course notes, the peer mentors, videos and engage in the most effective way of learning a new programming language, 

<center><img src="img/orly-changestuff.jpg" width="400" height="400" /></center>
<br>

then you will learn how to dominate debugging and come out a stronger and more capable of being able to answer research questions using data.
