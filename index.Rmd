### 4/8/19 - [Week 11](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk09.html)

DataFest is over and so I'm back 100% with you!

We're finishing up Bivariate Inference this week. 

* Correlation & Regression - similar, but different purposes. 
* HW 8 due this Saturday
* Think about which inferential tools you are going to want to use on your personal research questions. 

### 4/1/19 - [Week 10](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk09.html)

This week got lost in the post-sickness & pre-DataFest ether. 


### 3/25/19 - [Week 9](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk09.html)

The rest of the semester is all about Inference! This is what you've been training for, and waiting for. This week we'll start out with setting the foundations of the process on 1 variable, then quickly move into testing relationships between two variables. 

#### Due this week
* Hypothesis testing quiz on Tue/Wed
* HW 8 BIG assignment! Has multiple parts. Procrastinate and be doomed. 

#### Midterm Error Assessment (Optional - Due 4/5/19)
As an opportunity to look for patterns in your test taking and to develop strategies to perform better in the future, there is an optional error assessment that you can complete. If you do so you can earn up to half the points missed on the exam back. To do this you must use the [Analyzing exam errors form](reading/Analyzing exam errors.pdf) available on the materials page. Using this form you will: 

* Classify the types of errors you made (where you lost points). 
    - Identify common patterns or themes.
* On a separate paper, correctly re-work every problem you missed. 
* Go over your corrections with a tutor (or me). 
    - Explain what you did wrong and why your corrections are right.
    - Discuss strategies to perform better on future exams.

### 2/24/19 - [Week 6](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk06.html)

Now that you've had a chance to learn what your data looks like, exploring relationships and learning more about the variables that you are interested in researching, let's take a step back and look at the big picture. You will use lecture notes on writing empirical research (found on the materials page of this website) to guide the writing of a research proposal. 

Applied statistics is used to support research. Numbers and measures don't stand on their own. It is important that you understand how to use data to support scienctific research. 

So far you have been conducting an exploratory data analysis to learn the distributions of your measures, and to assess for any possible relationships in your research. You cannot make any statistical claims about whether or not a relationship is significant at this point. That is under the realm of _inferential statistics_ and will be the topic of the class after Spring break. 

To understand why inferential statistics can be used to make valid claims, we have to learn a little bit about _Probability_ first. This topic is only briefly covered in the PDS videos. You will have to spend more time in the course packet, AND in the OpenIntro textbook if you have never taken a statistics course before. 

This is a much more mathematical section of the course, so be sure to plan your time accordingly. Over the next two weeks you should be writing your research proposal, working on your poster preparation slides, and filling out the notes and examples in the course packet. We will be working heavily out of the course packet, so it is essential that you read the material ahead of time so the examples we work through in class are meaningful. 

#### Three quizzes this week
* Sun/Mon: Writing about empirical research. Based on these [lecture notes](lecture/lec02_writing_empirical_research.html). 
* Tue/Wed: Probability distributions. Based primarily on course packet chapter 3, and on PDS video 8 (only up to 14 minutes). 
* Saturday: Upcoming assignments. Making sure you know the expectations for the Research proposal and poster prep stage I. 


#### Events for this week (always free and open to all unless specified)

* Thursday 2-4pm, Tehama 116: **Data Science Seminar: Getting Started with R and Python** Are you ready to install R onto your own laptop? Do you want to try out Python? Come drop in and get help getting started with either of these two languages. 
* Saturday 3/2: Women in Business Summit https://www.csuchico.edu/cob/events/women-in-business.shtml 
* Monday 3/4: Women in Data Science technical conference. Live stream of the global conference out of Stanford, lunchtime career panel featuring local women in Data Science, and an opportunity to present your research in our "local women sympoisum" https://wids-chico.netlify.com/event/

### 2/18/19 - [Week 5](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk05.html) - Exploring Relationships


> It's ok to struggle, it's not OK to not do anything. If you are having trouble with coding, you need to ask for help. 
This class builds on each assignment. You can't do HW05 well if you didn't do HW04. You won't be able to do HW06 if you can't do HW05. 
Don't risk falling behind, you will struggle to catch up and may not pass. There are five of us available to help you with a combined total 10 hours of office hours. You can make appointments with any of us outside of our scheduled hours as well. 

* This week we will discuss how to create visualizations to assess the relationship between two variables. 
* The homework assignments are training grounds for you to practice how to create and interpret graphics to explore your research question. The graphs you make for the homework may or may not be directly related to your research question. 
* You may have to go back to your raw data and pull in new measures. Or adjust your variables (like collapsing levels) based on what you observed in last week's assignment. 
* Typo in the course notes on page 40. Be sure to get notes & the in-class worksheet from someone to make sure your book is updated. 

#### Items due this week:
* HW 06 - Bivariate Graphing
* Data Camp - Intro to Data (practice data management with R)
    - Don't forget to do the corresponding BBL quiz.
    
#### Events for this week (always free and open to all unless specified)

* [Data Science Seminar: Merging data from multiple tables using SQL](https://csudsi.netlify.com/2019/02/02/2019-02-02-dsi-seminar-spatial-is-special/) (Tu 2/19 3-4pm, Tehama 116)
SQL is a powerful database language that is used to link information together across multiple tables. http://datascience.csuchico.edu 

----

### 2/10/19 - [Week 4](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk04.html) - Making pretty pictures to win friends and influence people!

> No quiz on exploring numeric data. Prepare answers in the course notes section 2.1 instead (for Mon/Tue) and 2.2 (for Wed/Thu).

If there's one take home message for this week, is to describe the distribution of variables you need: 

1. a picture
2. summary statistics
3. a complete sentence interpretation

While your goal should be to make figures stand alone, you won't be there quite yet. Your coding skills will
develop as you go on throughout the semester. 

**Advice: Complete the `ggplot2` lesson in DataCamp (and corresponding blackboard learn quiz) EARLY this week. It will make coding in ggplot throughout the week much easier. **


#### Events for this week (always free and open to all unless specified)

* "Women Like You" Leadership Symposium (Drop in 10-2pm) https://as.csuchico.edu/women-like-you/ 
Distinguished female leaders share stories and discuss topics designed to inspire and empower all. With highlights from our own, Chico State faculty and staff will tell their personal stories of success and failure, sharing their journeys of resilience and rise as a woman in today’s social climate. Student attendees can enter to win from a pool of $5000 in textbook scholarship funds. 

* [Data Science Seminar: Spatial is Special](https://csudsi.netlify.com/2019/02/02/2019-02-02-dsi-seminar-spatial-is-special/) (Th 2-3pm, Tehama 116)
Learn how to start exploring and analyzing geographic data using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software. http://datascience.csuchico.edu

<p>

### 2/4/19 - [Week 3](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk03.html) - Hello R!

> OH Monday cancelled. I will be available 12-2pm and possibly 4-5pm instead. 

#### Second chance at Blackboard learn quizzes connected to DataCamp.
* The quizzes in Blackboard that correspond to DataCamp quizzes will be re-opened for partial credit this week. 

#### You have 2 assignments (and 2 pre-class video quizes) to turn in this week!
Read the instructions of each carefully to ensure that they are completed and submitted correctly. 

1. A literature review [[Homework 03]](hw/hw03_lit_review.html).
2. Demonstration of data management code [[Homework 04]](hw/hw04_data_management.html). 

We are starting to code in R this week. You must have completed the Data Camp assignments from last week to be ready for this. 
In class you will work with your partner to take a closer look at your codebook to identify what types of data management you will have to do. The [[lec03_dm_prep_questions]](notes/lec03_dm_prep_notes.html) lecture notes that can be found on the course materials page contain questions to help guide this process. 

#### Extra Materials

* I have created a video to walk you through how to get your data into R Studio. 
    - Right now this can only be acessed through Blackboard Learn. 
    - Watch this before class on Wednesday/Thursday
* The [[Help with R]](help_R.html) page has been updated to include more info such as useful functions and how to navigate data. 

#### Entering a challenging time

You may feel like this in the next couple weeks: 

<center><img src="img/hard.jpg" width="400" height="400" align='center'/></center>
<br>

But if you use the references in the course notes, the peer mentors, videos and engage in the most effective way of learning a new programming language, 

<center><img src="img/orly-changestuff.jpg" width="400" height="400" /></center>
<br>

then you will learn how to dominate debugging and come out a stronger and more capable of being able to answer research questions using data.
