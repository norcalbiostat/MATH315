### 9/21/17 - [Week 6](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk06.html)
I have gone through the gradebook and entered in 0's for missing assignments to date. This is done to provide you a better idea of where you stand grade-wise, going into this exam. Quizzes will remain open available up until the test on the 27th. So if you got a 0 on a Problem set or Data Camp quiz you have time to make up those points. This is also a good way to study for the exam. 


* Monday: Writing your research plan. Make sure you are paying attention to the research question spreadsheet. I'm leaving feedback and questions for you there!
* Wednesday: Exam 1. The weekly overview has details on how to prepare and a sample exam. 
* Friday: Probability. If it's been a while since you've had stats class you will have to spend some significant time preparing. 

### 9/18/17 - [Week 5](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk05.html)
* Recap the DM assignment template/instructions. 
* Univariate graphics assignment due this week. This is a peer reviewed assignment. Example template posted on [week 4](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk04.html).
* Peer review instructions have been added to the project page. 
* Monday we will lecture on how to interpret bivariate comparisons. The rest of the week you will work on creating them.

### 9/17/18 - [Week 4](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk04.html)

The optional revision period to your peer review assignments has been added to the submission instructions on the [[Help page]](help_assignments.html). 

**Data Management, Graphing and R errors Oh My!**
We'll talk about how to identify features of data that will need to be changed prior to analysis. We can't cover them all, nor would you remember them all. This is a place where experience and repetition will be the true learning method. In the meantime, I provide a number of resources to help you identify what to look for. 

You have 2 assignments to turn in this week 1) is your data management RMD code file, the other is a Graphing assignment. Be sure to carefully read the submission instructinos for each. 


### 9/3/18 - [Week 3](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk03.html)
* You should have been watching and following along with the PDS videos for about a week now. If you are not, do this ASAP or you will fall behind. Think of these as lecture, and in class as practice time. 
* You're going to be refining your research questions this week by conducting a literature review to see what the current state of knowledge is about your project. 
* Then we'll spend some time in the course notes learning how to describe the distribution of data using words, summary statistics and appropriate graphics.
* This is your last chance to get all your R/R Studio bugs resolved. Next week we're hitting the coding ground hard. 

_Note about EC: If you attended a seminar I need some sort of writeup from you to demonstrate that you payed some attention to the statistical or data analysis content of the talk._


### 9/04/18 - [Week 2](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk02.html) Data entry and import

Office hours (Holt 202) M: 3p-4m, W: 1-2pm, R: 10-11am
(_this weeks Wed hours are cancelled_)

This week we're going to be talking about data, doing some data entry and importing data into R.
You'll start to choose specific variables to address your research questions, create your own team mini-codebook and participate in our first project based assignment that comes with a peer review. 

Two great seminars lined up this week, one in Statistics one in Biology. Both are worth some EC if you attend. They're at the same time, so you can only attend one (obv.) Flyers with details are in Slack. 

Be sure to check the weekly schedule (linked above) for details on how to prepare for the week. 

**Upcoming Assignments**:

* Two (2) DataCamp chapters. This course module is written by the authors of the Open Intro Statistics textbook, the course title in Data Camp is "Data Analysis and Statistical Inference". In the Assignments tab in DataCamp, you will only see the chapter title. 
    - Introduction to R
    - Introduction to data
* Corresponding Blackboard Learn quizzes. _(2 attempts)_
* Problem set 2.2 - Blackboard quiz of 10 randomly selected questions from a pool of questions. _(Unlimited attempts)_
* hw02 - Research codebook assignment (created in Google Drive directly). Will be peer reviewed. 


### 8/27/18 - [Week 1](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk/wk01.html) Welcome to Fall 18!
* This course website contains all materials except the textbook for this class. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the organization. You will be here a lot. Bookmark this page.
