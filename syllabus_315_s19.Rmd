## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the semester students will be able to 

* Develop a testable research question. 
* Create and Understand how to use a codebook to identify data relevant to that question. 
* Process, screen, recode, transform, and clean data.
* Describe data using visualizations and words. 
* Select and carry out an appropriate statistical analysis.
* Explain study results and limitations to a non-technical audience. 
* Understand and implement a reproducible research pipeline. 
* Become a data nerd (Optional, but recommended).


## Required Materials

* **Textbook**: Open Intro Statistics https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os 
    - Free PDF or $15 hard copy
* **Course Notes**: Purchase from Chico Packet Pro for ~$25. Hours and locations in Blackboard. 
    - You will write directly into this inside and outside of class.

* **Lecture Videos:** This course uses lecture videos that are linked from the course website. These are an essential part of your learning materials. 
* **Reliable Laptop with internet connectivity**: Required to bring every day. Contact me if this poses a problem or concern for you. 
* **Headphones:** In case you forget to watch a required video before class you may be asked to do so in class. 
* **Computer Software:** All required software is free. We will start out using cloud based programs, but eventually you may want to install the programs on your own computer. Assistant will be available if needed. 
    
## Online accounts and materials
* **Course Website:** Everything! Schedule, syllabus, videos, notes, readings, homework etc. 
* **Blackboard Learn Use:** Grades, due dates, and quizzes. 
* **Google Drive** Surveys, data collection, written assignment submission, peer review and assignment feedback. 
* **Required Accounts** 
    - R Studio cloud. Use the link in Blackboard to join our workspace. 
    - Slack: http://math315-s18.slack.com. Use the link in Blackboard to join our workspace. 
        - Download either the desktop app or the phone app. 
        - Turn on notifications (they are not on automatically)
        - This is where I will make announcements and share assignment files as needed. 
    - Data Camp: An invitationto join will be sent to your campus email before the semester starts. 
        - If you already have a DataCamp account email me to let me know and I will manually add you to our classroom.

## Coursework

There are a variety types of assignments that I use to help you learn, and to assess how well you have
learned the material and can synthesize information. 

1. **Attendance**: Daily attendance is mandatory unless you talk to me ahead of time. You cannot take advantage of the learning time if you are not present. 
    - On days where we have open work day, you are still expected to stay and work. 
    - 1-2 days absent no penalty, 3-5 days absent 10% penalty, 5-10 days absent 50% penalty.
    - More than 10 days absent you earn no credit for attendance. 
2. **Participation & learning**: These activities are designed to foster peer learning and collaboration in and outside the classroom. 
    - You will be conducting peer reviews for nearly every assignment throughout the semester. 
    - Regular participation in Slack conversations. By asking and answering questions you can contribute to quality class-wide generation. Helping each other is more valuable than waiting for a response from me.
    - You must attend at least one community coding session, and visit me once during Office hours during the semester. 
3. **Quizzes**: Designed to ensure you are prepared for class and reinforce concepts we covered in class. 
    - Typically conceptual, sometimes computational.
    - Primarily administered through Blackboard Learn
    - Some are timed, some have unlimited attempts to earn the score you desire. 
4. **Data Camp (DC)**: We will use Data Camp as a way to start to learn R outside of class. 
    - You must be logged in to the Data Camp classroom to get access to the lessons. 
    - You must use the link emailed to you to join this classroom. 
    - There will be a corresponding BBLearn learn quiz associated with each lesson. 
    - You will have multiple (but not unlimited) attempts at these quizzes. 
    - Questions can be conceptual, interpreting results, and asking you to write code to demonstrate a task that was covered in the lesson. 
6. **Written**: Written assignments are methods to demonstrate you can apply the material that you learned to a new problem.
7. **Exams:** There will one midterm and one final exam. 
    - An Error Analysis can be conducted on the midterm to earn back up to half the credit missed. 
    - This is where you get back your exam, fix your mistakes, and explain your corrections verbally to either me or a tutor. 
8. **Project:** You will be working in pairs on a project throughout the term. 
    - Written assignments throughout the semester are specifically geared towards progressing your analysis project. 
    - You will present your work as a poster at the end of the semester. 
  

**Late work:** 

* Unless otherwise specified, you have roughly a week to do each assignment. 
    - Recall the due dates can be found in the BBL Calendar, or on the main schedule page. 
* **Late work is not accepted** 
 

## Grading

* Your final grade will be a straight sum of points earned and will be displayed as a running total in Blackboard Learn.  
* The approximate contributions per category are: Participation and learning X%, Quizzes X\%, Written assignments X\%, Exams X\%, and the Project X\%.   
* I use a standard grade cutoff of 100-90\%: A, 89-80\%: B, 79-70\%: C, 69-60\%: D, 0-59\%: F Plusses and minuses will be as displayed on Blackboard Learn.

# Policies

## Adding and Dropping the course

This course only runs for a few weeks and all materials are available on the course website. It will be difficult to get caught up if you add the class after the first week. The last day to add or drop classes without special permission by the instructor is 2/15/19. No adds or drops are allowed after 2/1/18 without a serious and compelling reason approved by the instructor, department chair, and college dean.
