# How do I complete the coding assignments? 

* A homework template file (`*.Rmd`)  will be provided for most to all assignments. 
* You will write your code and answers directly into the Rmd file, and "compile" or "knit" this file into a PDF for submission. 

# How/Where do I turn in assignments?
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, 

* The file should be clearly named using this format: `assignment_userid.pdf`. E.g. `univ_graphics_rdonatello.pdf`
* It should be in PDF format. 
* Uploaded to the corresponding folder in Google Drive. 
* Due dates are typically Saturday, but check the course website to confirm.

# Peer Reviewed Assignments
All project centered assignments will have a round of peer review before they are ready for grading. 
Here is the process that we will follow: 

* Your assignment is due on a Tuesday. 
* Your assignment will be reviewed by 2 of your classmates and one peer mentor over a 2 day period (Wed-Thu)
* You then have the option of revising your assignment over a 2 day period (Fri-Sat)
* The final deadline is after this review period (Saturday). Upload your final version to the `Ready for review` sub-folder for that assignment. 
    - If you do not move the file yourself I will take whatever has been uploaded already and move it to the `Ready for review` folder. 
    - Once I start grading the `ready for review` folder is locked to editing. 
    - It is your responsibility to ensure that this is the final version. 
    - I will not take submissions past the deadline, or by email. 
    
    
Assignments should be refined, reviewed, and absolutely spellchecked before submission. There is a built in spellcheck function in R studio. Use it. 


# What are you looking for when you grade? 

* That you followed the model example for that problem in the course notes. 
* That you followed directions. 
* Correct English grammar, spelling, formatting. 
* Concise, clear and complete answers. 
* Correct graphical and/or statistical methods used. 
* That you answered the question posed. 
* No extraneous output or code is showing. 


# How do you grade? 

* Grades are assigned using a rubric in Blackboard Learn. 
    - It would be a smart idea to check the rubric before you submit to ensure that you earn all possible points. 
* I will provide comments and feedback as appropriate on your assignment itself (while still in Google Drive)
    - This means that feedback is public, but grades are private.
