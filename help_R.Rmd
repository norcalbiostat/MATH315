# Using R on campus

What other computers on campus have R? 

* The three reserve computers in the first floor library. You have to ask to use these. (Confirmed 8/25/17)
* Butte 211 has an open computer lab.

# Downloading data
How to download the project data, and save it into a recommended file structure. When sharing code and analyses with others, it is essential to have the same or similar paths.

# Importing data into R
How to use the import code provided in the collaborative R code notes to import a CSV file into R. This video uses the NESARC data, which has over 3000 variables. This takes a while to load into R. This video also demonstrates how to use the `select` function within the `dplyr` package to only select certain variables to save (export) into a "clean" data set that can be used for later analysis.
