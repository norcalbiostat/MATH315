# PART III: Data Analysis Topic

### Team Formation
Yes yes, you hate group work. But having a person to bounce ideas off of, to help you debug your code, 
to help each other with difficult concepts is an invaluable aspect of learning. So, instead of complaining
make it a goal to be the best analysis partner! 

If you find yourself unsure how to manage or participate in a group, or you're terrified of working with other people, 
The [University of Minnesota](http://teamwork.umn.edu/) has a fantastic website devoted to surviving group projects.
You will have a group for immediate support in this class, but the project will be done in pairs. 

**Team Roster** Using the numbered list below, write the name of each team member and one interesting fact or tidbit you learned about them this week. Indicate who will be working together on the project.

2. 
3. 
4. 

### Area of research interest
Tell me what data set and topics you are interested in conducting research on and briefly why. If you are using one of the survey data sets (AddHealth, NESARC) that has hundreds or thousands of questions, be specific with the topics and sections that you plan to conduct research in.
