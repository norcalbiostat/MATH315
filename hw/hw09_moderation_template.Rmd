# ANOVA

1. **Identify response, explanatory, and moderating variables**

* Categorical explanatory variable = 
* Quantitative response variable = 
* Categorical Potential Moderator = 

2. **Visualize and summarise the potential effect of the moderator** 


3. **Write the relationship you want to examine in the form of a research question - including a statement about the modifier**


4. **Fit both the original, and stratified models.**


5. **Determine if the Third Variable is a moderator or not.**
