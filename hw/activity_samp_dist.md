In this activity you will be creating random samples to simulate a probability density distribution. We will create distributions of data (x), and see how they differ from the distribution of the average ($\bar{x}$). 

## Setup

* Each group of assigns one person to be a _roller_, one a _recorder_, and a _plotter_. 
* Get a blank plot from Dr. D. and the number of dice specified in the top right of the page. 
* The recorder logs into Google drive and opens the designated spreadsheet and identifies the group they are working in. 

## Phase 1: Create a random sample of $x$'s

* The roller rolls all dice and report the values to the recorder and the plotter. 
* The recorder enters the data into their assigned column.
* The plotter draws a dot above the value on the x-axis on the top graph. Stack the dots for repeated rolls vertically. 
* Collect as much data as you can in 5 minutes. 
* Draw a smooth line over the top of the data points to make a ``density" curve. 
* Describe the distribution of the xâ€™s in your HW07 file. Discuss location, shape, spread. 

## Phase 2: Create a random sample of $\bar{x}$'s. 

* Change rolling/recording/plotting rolls 
* The recorder enters the value of each die roll into the colored cells (x). 
    - The mean will automatically be calculated and displayed in the gray box. 
    - Record this calculated average in the xbar column and tell this number to the plotter.
* The plotter plots this data point as a dot on the bottom graph. 
* Collect as much data as you can in 10 minutes. 
* Draw a smooth line over the top of the data points to make a ``density" curve. 
* Describe the distribution of the $\bar{x}$'s in your HW 07 file.  Discuss location, shape, spread. 


## Wrap up
* Take a picture of your plot. 
* Upload to the `07 Foundatinos for Inference/Simulation` folder in Google Drive. 
* Name this file with your 'group' name (e.g. `3d4`)
