# Foundations for Inference

## Sampling distributions
Review Dr. D's analysis of the die rolling exercise. Answer the following questions. Using the die rolling activity to;  

1. explain the difference between a probability distribution and a sampling distribution.
2. Describe the concept of sampling variability.
3. As the sample size increases, describe what happens to the follwing features of the sampling distribution
      - mean:
      - standard deviation: 
      - shape
4. As the number of samples increases, describe what happens to the following of the sampling distribution
      - mean:
      - standard deviation: 
      - shape


## Create your own distribution
### Setup 

1. Open a web browser and go to: https://gallery.shinyapps.io/CLT_mean/
2.	Using the slider on the left side, reduce the sample size to 2, and the number of samples to 10. 
3. Orientation to this interactive app: 
  a. The blue plot at the top is the population distribution of the xâ€™s. 
  b. The smaller plots below are the results of random samples drawn from this population. Each data point (x) is shown as a dot, the vertical bar is the sample mean. 
  c. The green plot at the bottom is a histogram and density plot for the sampling distribution. This is the distribution of the means from each of the samples drawn above.

**Your job** Pick a shape (non-normal, and not uniform) for the population. If you chose a skewed distribution, play around with both a high and a low skew. If you chose a uniform distribution, play around with upper and lower bounds. 

1.	Adjust the number of samples. What happens to the sampling distribution (location/shape/spread)? 


2.	Adjust the sample size. What happens to the sampling distribution (location/shape/spread)? 


3.	At what sample size does the sampling distribution of a low skewed population become approximately normal? 


4.	What about for a distribution with high skew? 

## Confirm the Law of Large Numbers. 




## Explain the Central Limit Theorem
In *your own words*, based on what you have explored through simulation and information in the textbook, what does the Central Limit Theorem say?
