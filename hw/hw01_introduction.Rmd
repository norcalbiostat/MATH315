# Part I: Getting Started with research tools

## Slack
1. Go to http://math315-f19.slack.com and make an account to join our workspace. 
2. Download either the desktop app or the phone app. 
3. Post an introduction to yourself in the #introductions channel. Tell us a little about you! Year, major, hometown, any extracurricular activities, one thing you are hoping to get out of this class, and one concern you have about this class. Oh.. and of course any mention of pets should include a photo!
        
## R and R Studio
You have two choices for using R this semester. You can install the necessary programs on your personal computer, or you can use R studio cloud. If you have already taken or are concurrently enrolled in Math 130 you should install these programs on your own computer. 
### Install R and R Studio
* Follow the instructions from Math 130 to install and get started with R and R Studio. https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/notes/02_setup.html
* Complete all steps (including watching the video and organizing your working directory)


* If you are using R Studio in the cloud, follow these additional steps: 
1. Log into R Studio cloud, and click on our class workspace. 
2. Click on the `stats_project`. This will create a copy the R project into your own workspace. 
    - An "R project" is a pre-configured R environment along with a collection of files. 
3. Download the `hw01_introduction_template` from the class website, then upload
4. Replace your name and date in the header section. 
    - Don't delete the quotation marks. 
5. Complete the rest of the assignment below by writing the answers directly in the template. 
7. To see what the final report will look like, click the down arrow next to the `Knit` button and choose PDF. 
    - This turns your code file into a PDF report.
    - Do this often to make sure that your code and output is working as intended.
