# What is a literature review?

* Examination of the body of work that has been written about your topic
    - In this context, it is a VERB (but it can also be a NOUN)
* Why do I need to do it?
    - To understand the state of knowledge on your topic
    - You must do this because others have researched something along the same lines as what you are interested in
    - So you will be able to learn what methodologies, theories, or models others have applied to your research question
* It will help you ask your question better
* To refine (narrow, expand, focus, modify) your own research question 
* To contribute to your area with something new, which is science!
* It is the way you always introduce your topic, which you will be writing
    - Helps you create your argument as to why this is important
* It helps you interpret what you results are (later)
    - It gives you the context to evaluate your results


# What are the two main sources of scientific literature? 

## Primary source literature
* Journal articles reporting study results â€“ a researcher did a literature review, had data, analyzed it, and wrote up results in context.
* This is what you will be doing later, in poster form. 

## Secondary source literature
* Textbooks, handbooks, review papers, theoretical articles, magazines and newspapers (you CANNOT use these as a source for your paper)
* What are some problems with secondary source literature? 
    - Can describe or interpret results incorrectly
    - Can leave out important details


## How can you tell if it a primary source? 
* It has a title, abstract, introduction, method (with participants), results, discussion, and reference list.
    - What would "participants" look like for field biology research? Chemistry?  

# A few tips for your literature search
* Try to use articles that are published within the last 5-10 years
* Read the abstract, if sounds similar to your topic, read the participants, methods, and discussion at a glance then decide if you should keep or not
* As you read the literature, there should be an exchange between your research question and what you are learning. 
* The articles you are reading about should inform you about the association you are interested in testing.
    - Allows us to see what we KNOW and what we DO NOT KNOW
* Give special attention to the "future research" sections of the articles that you read. 
* Try to find a few articles that are looking specifically what you are looking at in terms of the association between your two specific topics.
    - This will tell you what we already know and the "future research"" in the discussions and conclusions sections will tell you questions that need more research.
    - If you can look at an association that has recently been identified as "area for future research" we have hit the jackpot in terms of topics.
