When not presenting, you will be scoring the other half of the class’s posters using this scoring sheet\nPosters can be in powerpoint (the standard format for research posters), or Google Slides (once appropriately sized)\n\nRegardless of the file type, you must use a template.

(You can ask for it, I just may not get to it until the next time I’m reviewing slides.)\nYou are responsible for keeping track of your status! Suggestion - use conditional formatting on column F in your sheet. This is the color scheme I use:\n\nGo to “Format –&gt; Conditional Formatting”\nSingle color, apply to range F2:F22\nFormat cells if\n\nText contains Not Assessible (Red)\nText contains ME (light green)\nText is exactly E (dark green)\nText contains NR (yellow)\n\n\n\n\nRubric\nThis is a method of ‘ungrading’ that I have been wanting to try for a while. At the math congress (camping conference) I attended the first week of October a math educator discussed this method with us and so I was inspired to finally test it out. This project is a perfect opportunity to do so.\nThis means that the Assessment item descriptions are a work in progress. Right now they are slightly modified from the old grading rubric. I may add, combine, or reword items as I do my revisions to better fit what I am actually looking for.\nEach person has their own ‘project assessment’ Google spreadsheet (same location as your poster) that shows you what achievement stage you are at for each item. It is locked to only view mode and only you and I have access to it.\n\n\n… but points!??\nIn the end this still has to be converted to a point value/letter grade right? So here’s how I’m going to do it. The poster prep slides make up 80 out of the 110 points for the project.\n\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 90% of assessment items at ‘exemplary’ and none at ‘needs revision’, that’s “A” work and you get the full 80 pts.\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 90% of assessment items at ‘meets expectation’ and no more than 1 at ‘needs revision’, that’s “B” work and you get 72 pts. Note ‘meeting expectation’ does not correspond to A level work\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 80% of assessment items at ‘meets expectation’ and no more than 2 at ‘needs revision’, that’s “C” work and you get 64 pts.\n\nThis is a graduate level class, so anything below a C is considered not passing. I don’t expect anyone to be at that stage by the end of the semester."
