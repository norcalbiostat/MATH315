    "text": "Grading Method\nInstead of assigning specific points to each stage and adding up the points for an overall score, this work will be done through a series of revisions gaining feedback from both your peers and the instructor at each stage.\n\nFor each slide to be assessed you will be marked as either “needing revision”, “meeting expectation”, or “exemplary”.\nI will update your status column for the slides that are being assessed at that stage.\n\nI will also check on any prior slides that are at ‘needs revision’ stage.\n\nYou can request a reassessment of prior work at (nearly) any time. (You can ask for it, I just may not get to it until the next time I’m reviewing slides.)\nYou are responsible for keeping track of your status! Suggestion - use conditional formatting on column F in your sheet. This is the color scheme I use:\n\nGo to “Format –&gt; Conditional Formatting”\nSingle color, apply to range F2:F22\nFormat cells if\n\nText contains Not Assessible (Red)\nText contains ME (light green)\nText is exactly E (dark green)\nText contains NR (yellow)\n\n\n\n\nRubric\nThis is a method of ‘ungrading’ that I have been wanting to try for a while. At the math congress (camping conference) I attended the first week of October a math educator discussed this method with us and so I was inspired to finally test it out. This project is a perfect opportunity to do so.\nThis means that the Assessment item descriptions are a work in progress. Right now they are slightly modified from the old grading rubric. I may add, combine, or reword items as I do my revisions to better fit what I am actually looking for.\nEach person has their own ‘project assessment’ Google spreadsheet (same location as your poster) that shows you what achievement stage you are at for each item. It is locked to only view mode and only you and I have access to it.\n\n\n… but points!??\nIn the end this still has to be converted to a point value/letter grade right? So here’s how I’m going to do it. The poster prep slides make up 80 out of the 110 points for the project.\n\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 90% of assessment items at ‘exemplary’ and none at ‘needs revision’, that’s “A” work and you get the full 80 pts.\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 90% of assessment items at ‘meets expectation’ and no more than 1 at ‘needs revision’, that’s “B” work and you get 72 pts. Note ‘meeting expectation’ does not correspond to A level work\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 80% of assessment items at ‘meets expectation’ and no more than 2 at ‘needs revision’, that’s “C” work and you get 64 pts.\n\nThis is a graduate level class, so anything below a C is considered not passing. I don’t expect anyone to be at that stage by the end of the semester."

    "text": "Example\nMy research question is: Is self-efficacy associated with parent relations and academic performance?\nWeiser, D. A., & Riggio, H. R. (2010). Family background and academic achievement: Does self-efficacy mediate outcomes? Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal, 13(3), 367-383.\n\nThis article discusses whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between family background and academic achievement. This is very similar to my topic but I feel that the component of mediation changes it slightly. I found that family predictors did not correlate with academic achievement as much as self-efficacy correlates with parent’s expectation of academic success. Self-efficacy is linked to grade point average and academic success expectations.\nThis information will be vital to understanding the extent to which self-efficacy is related to academic performance. With the correlation being weak for family background and academic performance, it will do less to determine the connection of parental relations to self-efficacy.\n\nTurner, E. A., Chandler, M., & Heffer, R. W. (2009). The influence of parenting styles, achievement motivation, and self-efficacy on academic performance in college students. Journal of College Student Development, 50(3), 337-346.\n\nThis study looks at how parenting styles, authoritative in particular, relate to academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation in college students. It claims that all factors, academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation, are all influenced by authoritative parenting. What I learned about my topic is this study did find that self-efficacy was not significantly linked to authoritative parenting.\nThis article will help explain how this specific type of parenting, authoritative, has little affect of self-efficacy. It does not however, claim that parenting, as a whole has not effect on self-efficacy. This study does confirm that parenting does reflect on academic performance.\n\nJunttila, N., Vauras, M., & Laakkonen, E. (2007). The role of parenting self-efficacy in children’s social and academic behavior. European Journal of Psychology of Education, 22(1), 41-61.\n\nThis article looks at parenting self-efficacy. This is a little different from my topic but there are aspects of it that will be useful. It tested Finnish mothers and fathers to test for loneliness, parent self-efficacy, their child’s peer evaluated social competence, self-evaluated loneliness and academic skills. It found that parents loneliness reflected in their self-efficacy. The relationship between parent self-efficacy and the child’s academic achievement were evaluated through the child’s social competence. What I learned from this article that I can use is that parent’s self-efficacy can be reflected in the children.\nThis article is gong to help me tie in influences in the parent relations with the children to determine self-efficacy. This is an interesting perspective that wasn’t originally in my research question but I believe it will give valuable insight."
