<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Syllabus for MATH 315 - Applied Statistics
I</h1>
<h4 class="author">Spring 2024</h4>

</div>


<blockquote>
<p>“Statistics in the service of research”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This course introduces you to modern statistical data analysis
techniques so that you can make data-informed decisions. At the end of
the semester you will present your research findings in a poster
presentation format to your peers.</p>
<p>In this project-based course, you will have the opportunity to answer
questions that you feel passionately about through independent research
based on existing data. The course offers a lot of one-on-one support,
directed opportunities to work with other students, and training in the
skills required to complete a project of your own design. We will use
collaborative tools and software that are common in many workplaces and
research labs. These skills will prepare you for many different career
types.</p>

</div>
<div id="required-materials-the-stuff" class="section level1">
<h1>Required Materials (the “stuff”)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Textbook</strong>: <a
href="https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os">Open
Intro Statistics</a>. Free PDF</li>
<li><strong>Course Notes</strong>: Purchase from Chico Packet Pro for
~$27. Hours and locations in Hw1.</li>
<li><strong>Lecture Videos</strong>: This course uses lecture videos
from a program called Passion Driven Statistics. These are essential
part of your learning materials. Plan to bring headphones in case you
need to watch these during class.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable Laptop</strong>: Expect to bring it daily. Contact
me if this poses a problem or concern for you.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable internet</strong>: connection while on and off
campus. ITSS can help you get this setup.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Software</strong>: R and R Studio through Posit
Cloud. $5/month. See note below about this cost.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts</strong>: (Free)
<ul>
<li>Campus Google account. This uses your <span
style="color:blue">(<span
class="citation">@mail.csuchico.edu</span>)</span> email.</li>
<li>Discord for class conversation. Sign up instructions are in
HW1.</li>
<li>Posit Cloud</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I try my absolute best to keep the cost of this course as low as
possible, and recognize that this is an yet another additional cost. I
wish, more than you know, that our campus would get their crap together
and setup a campus owned R Studio server so that this would be free. If
this cost is a burden please let me know and we’ll find an alternative
plan.</p>
<p><strong>But I thought R was free?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. R and R Studio are both free programs. Using the cloud is not a
long-term solution. You may have already installed these programs for
another class. If you are using R for another class after this, you are
highly encouraged to <em>eventually</em> install these programs on your
computer.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<ul>
<li>Not everyone has equal access to computers where this software can
be installed</li>
<li>The cloud provides additional benefits such as
<ul>
<li>shared projects and code within analysis teams</li>
<li>installation and setup has been done for you</li>
<li>less worry about poor file management systems (e.g. letting
everything live in your downloads folder)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>These are my reasons for why I would like us all to use the cloud
this semester.</p>

<h1>Class Format (how do we use that stuff?)</h1>
<p>You’ve heard of a “flipped classroom” before right? Well this is
kinda that. This course provides a series of lessons and assignments
aimed at preparing students conceptually and technically for the various
steps taken in completing their research project. You are expected to
make marked progress each week and to come to class prepared with
questions and planned next steps. It is important to note that to really
learn the material and skills presented in this course, you will need to
devote a substantial amount of out of class time working on this
class.</p>
<div id="before-class" class="section level3">
<h3>Before class</h3>
<ul>
<li>Watch the Passion Driven Statistics videos where assigned.</li>

<div id="everyone-is-welcome-here" class="section level2">
<h2>Everyone is welcome here</h2>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>I would like to create a learning environment that supports a
diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your
identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability,
etc.) To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ
from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point
to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want
to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately
as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to
honor your name.</li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and
talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule
and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general
announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).</li>
<li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the
Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
530-898-4764, and email <a href="mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu"
class="email">diversityoffice@csuchico.edu</a></li>
<li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about
diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
(Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Adapted from <a
href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements">Monica
Linden at Brown University</a></em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on
lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area,
the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with
this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our
campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda
people for centuries.</p>

<div id="attendance" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to
miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason,
DM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive.</p>

<li>Like it or not, it’s here to stay. We all have different levels of
risk we are willing to take ourselves, and different risk management
strategies.</li>
<li>Masks will ALWAYS be welcome and respected in this classroom. No
questions.</li>
<li>Please keep up to date with available booster shots. You can’t learn
if you’re ill.</li>
<li>If you are just generally feeling unwell, please use a mask. I will
always have some on hand.</li>

<p>If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms DM me
in Discord we’ll make a backup plan so you can rest while protecting
your classmates.</p>

<div id="late-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Late work</h2>
<p>In general, work isn’t considered ‘Late’ until someone is waiting for
you. This means there is little grace period for draft assignments. Do
you want your reviews back in a timely manner? You should show them the
same courtesy and professionalism.</p>
<p>If I have to pester you several times to submit your work, or you
submit your work after I’m done grading the rest of the class, not only
will it take longer for me to get feedback to you, it will receive a 10%
penalty.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration" class="section level2">
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when
they have someone else to talk through concepts with.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration on exams is not allowed.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="peer-reviews" class="section level2">
<h2>Peer Reviews</h2>
<p>If you consistently do not turn in draft assignments that is complete
enough for a review, or consistently provide sub-par reviews to your
classmates, I reserve the right to stop assigning you work to review and
stop having your work reviewed. You will not have the ability to make up
these points.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-of-ai" class="section level2">
<h2>Use of AI</h2>
<p>As an instructor I recognize there are a variety of AI programs
available to assist in creating text and writing code. However, I want
to stress that, AI programs are not a replacement for human creativity,
originality, and critical thinking. Writing (text and code) is a skill
that you must nurture over time in order to develop your own individual
voice, style, and view.</p>
<p>The use of chat GPT is allowed/encouraged <strong>to help you learn
how to code</strong> but all code used must be fully explained in text.
We will cover what this means and how to do this when we start data
management. <a
href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code/">How
ChatGPT can help you write code</a></p>
<p>You are responsible for fact checking the accuracy of statements
composed by AI language models.</p>
<div id="be-up-front" class="section level4">
<h4>Be up front!</h4>
<p>When presenting text written by Artificial intelligence (AI) language
models, such as ChatGPT, you must include an appropriate citation. <a
href="https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt">https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt</a></p>
<p>This also goes for when you have it write code for you. You need to
indicate when and where you used it.</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of

behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action.
Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or
plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at <a
href="https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml"
class="uri">https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml</a> if you
have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of
violating academic integrity.</p>
