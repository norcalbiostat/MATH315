<blockquote>
<p>“Statistics in the service of research”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This course introduces you to modern statistical data analysis techniques so that you can make data-informed decisions. At the end of the semester you will present your research findings in a poster presentation format to your peers.</p>
<p>In this project-based course, you will have the opportunity to answer questions that you feel passionately about through independent research based on existing data. The course offers a lot of one-on-one support, directed opportunities to work with other students, and training in the skills required to complete a project of your own design. We will use collaborative tools and software that are common in many workplaces and research labs. These skills will prepare you for many different career types.</p>

<div id="class-format-how-do-we-use-that-stuff" class="section level2">
<h2>Class Format (how do we use that stuff?)</h2>
<p>You’ve heard of a “flipped classroom” before right? Well this is kinda that. This course provides a series of lessons and assignments aimed at preparing students conceptually and technically for the various steps taken in completing their research project. You are expected to make marked progress each week and to come to class prepared with questions and planned next steps. It is important to note that to really learn the material and skills presented in this course, you will need to devote a substantial amount of out of class time working on this class.</p>
<div id="before-class" class="section level3">
<h3>Before class</h3>
<ul>
<li>Watch the Passion Driven Statistics videos where assigned.</li>
<li>Read through the course packet and fill in the blanks</li>
<li>Take the corresponding individual quiz (Due sunday night). These quizes make up almost 30% of your grade and will be taken directly from the videos and coures packet notes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="during-class" class="section level3">
<h3>During class</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will briefly review the topic for the day</li>
<li>(Monday) Go over any quiz questions that were very low scoring as a group.</li>
<li>Then it’s your turn to work on your research project with the support of me and peer mentors.</li>
<li>Work with others, seek additional support and clarification, and provide and receive help from peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This class is an implementation of a program called “Passion Driven Statistics” developed at Wesleyan university and dissemenated nationwide as part of a NSF Grant. You can learn more about this program here: <a href="https://passiondrivenstatistics.com/" class="uri">https://passiondrivenstatistics.com/</a>. As a student in this class, you may be contacted by Lisa Dierker at Wesleyan to participate in a pre- and post-course survey. If you choose not to participate it will not affect your grade but I will give a few extra points towards participation if you choose to respond. Your input in assessing this program is is valued.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="mututal-expectations" class="section level2">
<h2>Mututal Expectations</h2>
<p>I am a very personable individual who likes to get to know my students as well as let the students get to know me. I am a fair instructor, but I realize that not everyone digs my teaching style. In full acknowledgement of this I provide as many resources for success as possible; therefore, success in this course is accomplishable if you do your part. The quizzes, assignments, and project are a challenge, therefore, ample time preparing is necessary.</p>
<p>The peer mentors and I are here for you, but you have to use your voice and speak with me about any concerns you may have. The best way to contact me is through Slack, or email. To keep students informed about the course I send out weekly updates through Slack.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that I teach multiple sections of the same course. That means I <em>will</em> forget who I told what to. I will do my best to be as organized as possible to make things smooth for you. I need you to understand that I am only human (omg!), and to have patience and understanding with me. Broken links on the website? Mixed up dates somewhere? Tell me so I can fix it!</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-support" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional Support</h2>

</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>

<h1>Policies</h1>
<div id="late-assignments" class="section level2">
<h2>Late Assignments</h2>
<p>All assignments are to be completed upon the due date as announced by the instructor. All assignments have a portion of the grade dedicated to timeliness. Exceptionally late assigments are graded at the instructors discretion and there is no guarantee that the assignment will be returned in a timely manner. Just like you have your deadlines, I have mine. No exceptions will be made. In cases of emergency, please contact your instructor immediately.</p>

<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml" class="uri">https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml</a> if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity.</p>
</div>
<div id="scientific-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Scientific Integrity</h2>
<p>The rules of science should be carefully upheld in everything that you do. The following behavior is absolutely unacceptable: Data fabrication, selective reporting, omission, suppression or distortion. Please be mindful that there is no such thing as a “little scientific misdemeanor.”</p>
</div>
<div id="plagiarism" class="section level2">
<h2>Plagiarism</h2>
<p>Using someone else’s words or ideas without properly citing them is plagiarism. The CSU academic integrity policy distinguishes between misuse of sources and intentional plagiarism. If a student makes an attempt to "identify and credit his or her source, but does so improperly, he or she will not be penalized according to our policy. However, students should make every effort to learn the proper format for correctly citing sources, since this is an essential aspect of academic work.</p>
<p>Intentional plagiarism occurs when the student “deliberately uses someone else’s language, ideas, or other original (not common knowledge) material without acknowledging its source”" and in so doing represents them as his or her own. This includes borrowing another’s phrases or sentences without using quotation marks or citations; cutting and pasting whole paragraphs (or papers) from websites without acknowledgement; or borrowing ideas from someone without citing them.</p>
<p>This is a generally open / community learning environment. Blatent code plagerism is not only obvious, greatly hinders your ability to learn, and is not tolerated. Sharing code is encouraged, but sharing words/explanatory text is not allowed. Both parties will recieve a 0 for whatever assignment is at stake.</p>

<div id="adding-and-dropping-the-course" class="section level2">

<p>The last day to add or drop classes without special permission by the instructor is 9/6/19. No adds or drops are allowed after 9/20/19 without a serious and compelling reason approved by the instructor, department chair, and college dean.</p>
