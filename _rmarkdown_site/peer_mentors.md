# Peer Mentors for Spring 19

Unless specified otherwise, scheduled office hours for Peer Mentors are held in the Math tutoring lab, 4th floor of Miriam Library. They also are part of our Slack workspace. 


You can request help outside their regular office hours _at their discretion_ by asking in the #tutor-request channel in Slack.
