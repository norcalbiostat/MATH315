In this activity you will be creating random samples to simulate a probability density distribution. We will create distributions of data (x), and see how they differ from the distribution of the average ($\bar{x}$). 

## Setup

* Sit in groups of 4 (and 1 group of 2)
* Get out a blank piece of paper. You will be writing information you need for Hw07 here. 
* Each group of assigns one person to be a _roller_, one a _recorder_, and a _plotter_. 
* The _plotter_ get a blank plot from Dr. D. and the number of dice specified in the top right of the page. 
* The _recorder_ opens the spreadsheet in the `07 Foundations for Inference/Simulation` folder in Google Drive. 
    - All other computers are put away



## Phase 1: Create a random sample of $x$'s

* The roller rolls all dice and report the values to the recorder and the plotter. 
* The recorder enters the data into their assigned column.
* The plotter draws a dot above the value on the x-axis on the top graph. Stack the dots for repeated rolls vertically. 
* Collect as much data as you can in 5 minutes. 
* Draw a smooth line over the top of the data points to make a ``density" curve. 
* Write down a description of the distribution of the $\bar{x}$ on your blank paper. Discuss location, shape, spread. 

## Phase 2: Create a random sample of $\bar{x}$'s. 

* Change rolling/recording/plotting rolls 
* The recorder enters the value of each die roll into the colored cells (x). 
    - The mean will automatically be calculated and displayed in the gray box. 
    - Record this calculated average in the xbar column and tell this number to the plotter.
* The plotter plots this $\bar{x}$ (mean) as a dot on the bottom graph. 
* Collect as much data as you can in 10 minutes. 
* Draw a smooth line over the top of the data points to make a ``density" curve. 
* Write down a description of the distribution of the $\bar{x}$'s on your paper.  Discuss location, shape, spread. 


## Wrap up
* Take a picture of your plot. 
* Upload to the `07 Foundations for Inference/Simulation` folder in Google Drive. 
* Name this file with your 'group' name (e.g. `4d10`)
